# Editor
The Editor used by developers to make games with Polaris Game Engine

# GPL WHO?
Yes, the *editor* is GPL licensed. HOWEVER, the engine itself AKA the API is NOT!
So, because the API is MIT licensed and the games you make won't use the editor,
you can distribute your game however you like.
Keep in mind that while this is the editor that's meant to be used with Polaris,
we are NOT affiliated with the Polaris group. We just happen to work side by side 
with them, and we are making this editor for you to use to make games with that API.
Separate group, same leader, so I guess technically some affiliation as I am 
writing both repositories, but as a group it is a separate organization that
is NOT affiliated in the grand scheme of things. I just want to make it clear
that this is NOT the same project.

# API
The Polaris API is available here: https://github.com/Git-Polaris/API

# WIP
Remember that this is still being worked on and is not yet usable.
